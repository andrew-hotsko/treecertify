# CLAUDE.md — Project Rules

## Verification
- Do NOT use the preview/screenshot tool to verify changes. Clerk auth redirects block the preview. Verify through build checks and server logs only.

## Workflow
- Always commit and push when you finish a task.

## Tech Stack
- This is a Next.js App Router project with Prisma (PostgreSQL via Neon), Clerk auth, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components.

## Certification
- Reports must pass validation before certification. `lib/report-validation.ts` exports `validateReportForCertification()` which runs blocking (fail) and advisory (warning) checks.
- The certify API route (`app/api/reports/[id]/certify/route.ts`) enforces server-side validation — returns 400 if any check has status `fail`.
- The UI shows validation results in Step 1 of the certification ceremony dialog and as a status indicator in the toolbar.

## Auth
- Do not break existing authentication — all routes under /(app)/ are protected by Clerk middleware.

## Session Completion
- When all tasks are complete, always end with **SESSION COMPLETE** in bold, followed by a numbered list of what was done and what was changed.
